  <h1>This is going to be a tutrial about minecraft</h1>
  <p>so what you want to do first is start mining when you load into survival mode</p>
  <p>so when you get that mastered what you want to do is creat a crafting table and start crafting the resources that you have</p>
  <p>so the order that you need to get all weapons is, first you need 3 blocks of coblestone and then you need 3 sticks for a coble stone pickaxe and for every thing other like diamond, gold, iron, and nether and all kinds of other weapons, so next you need iron for iron weapons, then you need gold, next you need diamond, last you need nether for the strongest weapons</p>
  <p>so when you get that all done what you want to do is get started at a house and put most of your expensive stuff in a chest so when you die you will respawn at your respawn point which is the bed</p>
  <p>so when you do all of thsoe steps done you want to try to get the matirials for the ender dragon and when you beat him you will finish the game of minecraft</p>
  <p>last those people that do not know how to play minecraft hate to break it to you but you will never beat the game of minecraft</p>
